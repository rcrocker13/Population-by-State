# State Population from the US Census Bureau

This code gives you access to August 2010's state population data.

The call we're making doesn't only pull back population though. With this script you have access to State Population Estimates by **Single Year of Age, Sex, 5 Races, and Hispanic Origin**.

Feel free to fork the code yourself and make your own calls to throught the [US Census API](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/population-estimates-and-projections.html). To avoid hitting a call limit on my key you can request your own [here](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

You can download the data this script logs [here](https://github.com/rcrocker13/Population-by-State/blob/master/pop-by-state.csv)
