# State Population from the US Census Bureau

This code gives you access to August 2010's state population data.

The call we're making doesn't only pull back population though. Withing the body variable you have access to State Population Estimates by Single Year of Age, Sex, 5 Races, and Hispanic Origin.

Feel free to fork the code yourself and make your own calls to throught the US Census API (http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/population-estimates-and-projections.html).
